Refund Policy

Last Updated: January 2024

30-Day Money-Back Guarantee

We offer a 30-day money-back guarantee for all new subscriptions. If you're not satisfied with our service within the first 30 days of your initial subscription, you can request a full refund.

How to Request a Refund

To request a refund:
1. Go to Settings > Billing
2. Click "Request Refund"
3. Select a reason for your refund request
4. Submit your request

Refund requests are typically processed within 5-7 business days. Refunds will be issued to the original payment method used for the purchase.

Refund Eligibility

Refunds are available for:
- New subscriptions within 30 days of first payment
- Annual plans canceled within 30 days
- Duplicate charges (will be refunded immediately)

Refunds are NOT available for:
- Subscriptions older than 30 days
- Monthly plans after the first month
- Add-on purchases
- Usage-based charges

Partial Refunds

If you upgrade or downgrade your plan mid-cycle, we'll prorate the charges. If you downgrade, you'll receive a credit for the unused portion of your higher-tier plan.

Cancellation vs Refund

Canceling your subscription stops future charges but does not automatically issue a refund. You'll retain access until the end of your current billing period. To receive a refund, you must request it separately within the 30-day window.

Chargebacks

If you file a chargeback with your bank instead of contacting us, your account will be immediately suspended. Please contact our support team first - we're happy to help resolve any issues.
